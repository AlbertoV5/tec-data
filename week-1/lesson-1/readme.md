## Category Statistics:

The following chart represents the data filtered by Parent Category in any country. We can see that the theater category has the highest amount of successful Kickstarters although not the highest Successful to Failed/Canceled campaigns ratio.

## SubCategory Statistics

The following chart shows all the Sub Categories of all Parent Categories, giving us a better understanding on what kind of projects are more likely to succeed. For example, all Animation, Food Trucks, Dramas and Jazz projects seem to have never succeeded, to name a few.

That is all for the required material but I decided to take a deeper dive on the Kickstarter campaigns under ther Parent Category of Music.

Doing a bit of digging on the Music SubCategories, we can find a few cases where some sub categories completely failed compared to other sub categories that always succeeded.
