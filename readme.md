## Class 1

**Pivot Table**: Transpose rows and columns into different ways of visualizing data. Summarizes data.

Research: Tableau, Sisense, Salesforce

To name a range/table: "Select table then go to top left and double click the range and set a new name".

**Vertical Lookups**: Look on first column of destination table and try to match a given value. If found, go to n column of that row and return its value. Use FALSE/TRUE for exact match. If not exact, it grabs the closer value within a range, assumming that the table is sorted.

Shortcut -> "F4" for adding the $ symbol to a range or cell, which makes it a constant when dragging the same formula across different cells.

**Calculated Fields**: A way to add new columns to a Pivot Table with a formula. So adding new data/values based on existing one, like a total or sum.
